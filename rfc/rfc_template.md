## Background

This section paints the context to the reviewers, and clarifies why we need to solve this problem. It should be concise and on point.

## Goal(s) / Scope

This section describes design requirements and everything you want to achieve with this design. Use a numbered list for each goal as pros/cons in the design option section should reference the goals (e.g. "this meets goal #1", "this violates goal #2))

## Non-Goal(s) / Out of scope

This section describes (in bullet points) anything that might be related to the design but is considered out-of-scope. Typically, non-goals arise during the review process when someone asks why something is not considered in the design, and you have a specific reason for not including it. So try your best to preemptively list non-goals to avoid questions or gaps in the final review process. Reasons for not including the non-goal should be mentioned.

## Pre-requisities for the feature

In bullet points.

## Design Options

Pick the most 2-4 reasonable options to consider. Each option with an exhaustive list of pros and cons. Preferably, each pros and cons should use goals as a measure to see if the option is good or bad in that dimension. But listing pros and cons that cannot be measured by goals are still important if it is relevant to the design decision (e.g. if cost is not part of the goal, but option 1 is free while option 2 is not free).

### Option 1 - short description

Longer description (use pictures, state/sequence diagrams, flow charts, steps, etc. if applicable).

List of
- Pros
- Cons

### Option 2 - short description

Longer description (use pictures, state/sequence diagrams, flow charts, steps, etc. if applicable).

List of
- Pros
- Cons

## Conclusion

The chosen solution. Why did you choose this option? Elaborate.

## Action points

List of action points to implement and test the feature (provided the document has been approved). Actions to mitigate the cons should also be listed in this section.
